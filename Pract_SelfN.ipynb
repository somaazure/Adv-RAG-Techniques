    "1. **Read and preprocess PDF**: Loads and extracts text from a PDF file using `PyPDF`, filtering out empty pages.\n",
    "2. **Split text**: First splits large text into manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, then refines these chunks based on token count with `SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter`.\n",
    "3. **Embed text**: Initializes a `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` and creates a Chroma vector store (`chromadb`) to embed and store the processed text.\n",
    "4. **Indexing**: Each chunk is embedded and added to a Chroma collection with unique IDs.\n",
    "5. **Querying**: A natural language query is used to retrieve top-matching document chunks based on vector similarity.\n",
    "6. **Query augmentation**: The query is enhanced using OpenAI’s GPT model to generate a hypothetical answer, creating a more informative \"joint query.\"\n",
    "7. **Re-query**: The joint query is re-run on the vector store to retrieve even more contextually relevant documents.\n",
    "8. **Embeddings for visualization**: Embeddings of the dataset, query, and results are reduced to 2D using UMAP for plotting.\n",
    "9. **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to plot the embedding space, showing the dataset, query, and retrieved document positions.\n",
    "10. **Purpose**: This process builds a mini-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with visual insight into how queries relate to embedded document content.\n"

       "['Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners,  \\nWe are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity. As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic, \\nsocial, and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform \\nproductivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our most pressing \\nchallenges.  \\nThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight years \\nafter its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server, to Web/\\nInternet, to Cloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once again, as we \\nlead this new era.  \\nAmid this transformation, our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve \\nmore remains constant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of \\ntechnology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.  \\nHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:  \\n• Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the \\nhealthcare industry today—including physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built \\non Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot.  \\n• Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50  percent with GitHub \\nCopilot, as the company works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.  \\n• Mercedes-Benz is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using \\nChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service.  \\n• Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value-\\nadded activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.  \\n• Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI, and \\nAzure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.  \\n• And, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students \\nlearn English using Azure AI.  \\nTo build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial \\ncloud while innovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know \\nthat maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI \\nby infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage, \\naligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.  \\nAs we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211  billion in \\nrevenue and over $88 billion in operating income.  \\nA NEW ERA OF AI  \\nThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural \\nlanguage. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive human-\\ncomputer interfaces—keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—\\nnatural language—and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around \\nus.  \\n  \\nThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things \\nand organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over \\nit. This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or summarizing text, to \\ndetecting anomalies and recognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.  \\nTogether, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our \\nvision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences \\nand allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications \\nor use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to \\nshop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.  \\n1',\n",
       " 'As a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. We believe AI should be as empowering \\nacross communities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed, with safety in \\nmind from the outset.  \\nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \\nEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly what \\nwe’ve already begun to do:  \\nInfrastructure  \\nFour years ago, we first invested in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference. \\nToday, it’s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services, including one of \\nthe fastest-growing consumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection, is \\nalso using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models.  \\nMore broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their \\nmission-critical applications. We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains early \\nwhen it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which \\nnow has 18,000 customers.  \\nData and AI  \\nEvery AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our \\nIntelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend \\nmore time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year, which \\nunifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model.  \\nWith Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. We offer the best selection of \\nindustry-leading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, bringing \\ntogether advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000 \\norganizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose \\nus this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI Studio, we provide a \\nfull lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help \\nensure they are deployed and used safely.  \\nDigital and app innovation  \\nGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent \\nfaster. More than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than 1  million people \\nhave used GitHub Copilot to code faster. We also announced our vision for the future of software development with \\nGitHub Copilot X, which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub \\nsurpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year.  \\nWe’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate \\nworkflows, create apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in \\nPower Platform. More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform to date.  \\nBusiness applications  \\nWe are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with \\nDynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry, \\ncontent generation, and notetaking. In fact, our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service \\nto resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform, we’re helping \\ncustomers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can infuse their \\ncustomer interactions with data from CRM systems—including both Salesforce and Dynamics—to close more deals.  \\nAll up, Dynamics surpassed $5  billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and \\nfinance and supply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.  \\n2',\n",
       " 'Industry  \\nAcross industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from \\nAI. In healthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX \\nCopilot. The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to \\nface with patients. And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system.  \\nAnd, in retail, we introduced new tools to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical \\nstores.  \\nModern work  \\nWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and \\nproductivity, with both our established applications like Office and Teams, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and \\nLoop. Microsoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.  \\nThis year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines next-generation \\nAI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and \\nunleash their creativity at work. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot \\ngenerally available to our commercial customers later this year.  \\nWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. We introduced a new \\nversion of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50  percent less memory. We also \\nintroduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up, \\nTeams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this year.  \\nWith Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way \\nto build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed \\n35 million monthly active users.  \\n  \\nSecurity  \\nAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our \\ncomprehensive, AI-powered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot, we’re combining large \\nlanguage models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to \\ntransform every aspect of security operations center productivity.  \\nAll up, more than 1  million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital \\nestates, and our security business surpassed $20  billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds \\nand endpoint platforms.  \\nSearch, advertising, and news  \\nWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser, which brings together \\nsearch, browsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat \\nexperience, and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.  \\nWe are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial \\ndata protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next-generation AI today.  \\nAlthough it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1  billion chats and created more than 750  million \\nimages over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine \\nconsecutive quarters.  \\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology \\nand sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any \\npublisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them.  \\n3',\n",
       " 'LinkedIn  \\nThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and \\nfinance, to software development and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and \\nuplevel their skills. We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the \\nexperiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our AI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the \\nnetwork.  \\nAll up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the \\nplatform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.  \\nGaming  \\nIn gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, \\nwherever, and however they want. With Xbox Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and \\nviewed. Content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was especially \\nenergizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim, with more than 10  million players in the first month post-launch \\nalone.  \\nEarlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing more in \\nthe coming months about how, together, we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.  \\n  \\nDevices and creativity  \\nFinally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot, which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 \\nupdate last month. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you are \\ndoing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront. \\nOverall, the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also transforming \\nhow Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed \\n$1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.  \\nOUR RESPONSIBILITY  \\nAs we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new ones. \\nTo do this, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater \\nimportance in this new era. For us, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us make \\ndecisions across everything we do—as we design and develop products, shape business processes and policies, help our \\ncustomers thrive, build partnerships, and more—always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are \\naligned with them.  \\nHow can we expand opportunity?  \\nFirst, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community, and \\ncountry. And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has access to \\nthe technologies, data, and skills they need to benefit.  \\nTo achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other civil \\nsociety organizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest challenges. This \\nyear, we provided nonprofits with over $3.8  billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly 325,000 nonprofits used \\nour cloud. And to help them tap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for fundraising, marketing, and \\nprogram delivery.  \\nAI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10  million people by \\n2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped 8.5  million \\npeople, including 2.7  million this year. We’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in \\ncybersecurity, working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our efforts.  \\nFinally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in \\npartnership with LinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in the \\nUS. These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. We also partnered \\nto launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research or academic \\ninstitutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AI.  \\n4']"

    "\n",
    "Let me explain what each type of dot represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔘 **Gray Dots**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What they are**: These are the **UMAP-projected embeddings of all the document chunks** in your Chroma collection (after token splitting + embedding).\n",
    "* **Purpose**: They represent the full embedding space of your PDF content — each dot is a chunk of the annual report.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟢 **Green Circles (with or without borders)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What they are**: These are the **retrieved document chunks** returned by ChromaDB when you searched with the query.\n",
    "* **Why they matter**: They are the **most relevant chunks** according to vector similarity (top 5 results).\n",
    "* May be visualized differently depending on how `plt.scatter` is called (some might be filled, some outlined).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟧 **Orange Star**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is**: This is the **augmented (joint) query embedding**, i.e., the original query combined with a GPT-generated hypothetical answer.\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Used to improve retrieval quality by adding extra semantic context.\n",
    "* **Why it’s near green dots**: Because the augmented query helps \"pull\" the search closer to where relevant chunks lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **Red X**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is**: This is the **original query embedding** (before GPT augmentation).\n",
    "* **Why it's far**: Sometimes the raw query is too vague or lacks key terms present in the document — so it's embedded in a different region.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This image shows **how query formulation affects retrieval**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **red X (original query)** lies far from the relevant documents.\n",
    "* The **orange star (augmented query)** is embedded closer to the green dots (retrieved docs), meaning it captures more relevant context.\n",
    "* The **green dots** are successfully retrieved chunks.\n",

    "Question:\n",
    "what is the significance of CrossEncoder in sentence_transformers ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The `CrossEncoder` in the `sentence-transformers` library is a powerful model used for tasks that involve comparing pairs of sentences (or more generally, text inputs). It differs significantly from the more common `SentenceTransformer` model in how it handles and processes input, which directly impacts its accuracy and performance trade-offs.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **What is a CrossEncoder?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `sentence-transformers`, a `CrossEncoder`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Takes two sentences (or pieces of text) as joint input** and feeds them together into a transformer model.\n",
    "* **Does not encode the sentences independently** like `SentenceTransformer` (bi-encoder) models.\n",
    "* Outputs a **single score or classification** for the pair, typically used for ranking or binary classification (e.g., \"are these sentences similar?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')\n",
    "score = model.predict([(\"This is a sentence\", \"This is another sentence\")])\n",
